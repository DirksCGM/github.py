# Contributing to github.py

The following is a set of guidelines, not rules, for contributing to github.py.


## Issue Guidelines

A good example issue can be found [here](https://github.com/ShineyDev/github.py/issues/5).

For the most part, the chosen issue template will walk you through what to put in each section.

- Do not open duplicate issues - they will be closed.
- Provide enough information for the issue to be workable.
    - If necessary information is missing, we will ask for it.
- Remember to check that the preview looks as you'd expect!


### Bug Report

- A concise **description** of the bug report, what exactly went wrong and how?
- Easy-to-follow **reproduction steps**. How did you get this result? How did you come across this bug?
- The **expected behavior**. What did you expect to happen here? What is different?
- The **actual behaviour**. What really happened here? If you got any exceptions, this is where you'd put them.
- Any **additional context**. Do you have anything to add to this?
- The **checklist**. All of the boxes should be checked before you send the issue.
- Your **system information**. We may need to know your python version and/or system information to reproduce this issue.


### Feature Request

- The **problem**. What made you want to make this feature request?
- The **ideal solution**. This is the part that separates this from a pull request, you write this in English, not python.
- The **current solution**. Don't worry about looking too far for a current solution, if it isn't obvious then you have another point to make.
- Any **additional context**. Do you have anything to add to this?


### Question

- Questions related to GitHub should be sent to [GitHub Support](https://github.com/contact) instead.


## Pull Request Guidelines

<!-- A good example pull request can be found [here](...). -->

- Do not open duplicate pull requests - they will be closed.
- Try to focus on a single aspect - if another pull request is necessary, create one.
- Try to follow general python guidelines; such as [PEP-8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
- Remember. :clap: To. :clap: Test.


### Commit Guidelines

- Use the present tense. (`implement ...` not `implemented ...`)
- Try to limit the first line to ~25 characters.
- Reference issues and pull requests outside of the first line.
    - Use the shorthand syntax. (`#123` or `user/repo#123` not `https://.../issues/123`)
